# This is an odd little script, possibly not relevant to anyone's workflow except mine.
# I have a problem: ocamlbuild as of 4.02.1 does not build dependent .cmo's if the
# entrypoint .ml has a syntax error. However, Merlin depends on ocamlbuild to build
# dependent .cmo's or it can't do syntax checking. This script, when run from project root,
# gets me out of the wedge state by forcibly building everything whether needed or no. --Andi
