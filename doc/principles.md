# Emily's underlying principles

*In no particular order*

## I am not important

### I trust you

## Minimize the number of concepts

## "Anything a code generator can do", in-language

### One language

### Define objects by their behavior, not their nature

## DRY/SWYM

Destroy all idiomatic code

## No parser

### Types determine what is possible

## Privilege ease over correctness

Programming should be easy.

### Correctness should be *possible*

## It is my job to make it hard for you to do something wrong by accident. It is not my job to make it hard for you to do something wrong on purpose.

## It should be hard to write yourself in a corner

## Don't pay for what you don't use

C++ gets this backward

## Deployability is all-important
